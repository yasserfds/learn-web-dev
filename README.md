# HTML Basics for Beginners

## Introduction

As a beginner programmer, I've recently delved into the world of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create the foundation of web development. Here's a summary of what I've learned so far.

## HTML Overview

HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It consists of elements represented by tags, which define the structure of a webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<tag>`.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

A typical HTML document has the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the HTML version.
`<html>`: The root element.
`<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
`<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage (displayed in the browser tab).
`<body>`: Contains the actual content of the webpage.

# HTML Elements
## Headings
```html
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<!-- ... up to h6 -->
```

## Paragraphs
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
## Lists
- Unordered List
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

- Ordered List
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```

## Links
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

## Images
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

## HTML Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Here are a few examples:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in a new tab</a>
<img src="image.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Description">
```

# Conclusion
These are just the basics of HTML that I've covered as a beginner programmer. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for building more complex web pages. I look forward to exploring more advanced topics and enhancing my web development skills.
