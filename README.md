# HTML Basics for Beginners

## Introduction

As a beginner programmer, I've recently delved into the world of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create the foundation of web development. Here's a summary of what I've learned so far.

## HTML Overview

HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It consists of elements represented by tags, which define the structure of a webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<tag>`.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

A typical HTML document has the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the HTML version.
`<html>`: The root element.
`<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
`<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage (displayed in the browser tab).
`<body>`: Contains the actual content of the webpage.

# HTML Elements
## Headings
`<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>`
`<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>`
<!-- ... up to h6 -->
